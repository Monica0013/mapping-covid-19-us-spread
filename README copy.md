I created this project to illustrate the spread and deaths due to COVID 19 in the US while also using an API.

The map itself comes from a custome static map that I created through Mapbox to illustrate the US. 

To interact with the project, there are check boxes on the tob where you can mark "Death" to see the number of Covid deaths and "Positive Cases" to see the number of positive confirmed cases across the US.

There is lso an animation that I included via the creating of a class called "Germs" to show the hypothetical constant spread of the virus. There is a button on the top of the screen that also allows you to reset the screen.
